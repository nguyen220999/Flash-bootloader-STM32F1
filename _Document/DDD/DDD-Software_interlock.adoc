== 2. Problem description

SW need a machanism to assure prevent writing flash unexpectively. Only when truth request update application software from truth host system, flash driver is valid.


_Constraints:_
NA

== 3. Solution Alternatives

=== 3.1 Set up security check before using flash driver (Solution A)

When FBL need use API of flash driver, it need to check security. When Host system request update app SW, FBL will provide seed, host system must provide public key, FBL will check and perform call API follow request.

=== 3.2 Flash driver is not stored in system (Solution B)

Flash driver is stored in host system. When host system need reflash new app software, it will transfer flash driver to FBL

== 2. Problem description
Need method can be fexible in setup building software to add tool in order to increase performance in build 

_Constraints:_
NA

== 3. Solution Alternatives

=== 3.1 Global variable - One-for-all (Solution A)
One variable to communicate between modules

=== 3.2 Global variable - Multi-for-all (Solution B)
Each linkage communication will have difference variable

== 4. Design Decision Criteriaâ€™s/ Architecture divers
=== 4.1 Complexity, Modularity
Easy to handle

=== 4.2 Reusability, Portability, Deployability

== 2. Problem description
Need method can be fexible in setup building software to add tool in order to increase performance in build 

_Constraints:_
NA

== 3. Solution Alternatives

=== 3.1 All-in-one tool (Solution A)
Tool is provided by external and include compiler, make,...
Developer only need create project workspace and implimentation.
No need to care about make,...

=== 3.2 complie partial tool (Solution B)
Install needed partial tool.
Developer can use any things to perform code and use bat script provided by own project member to build software

== 4. Design Decision Criteriaâ€™s/ Architecture divers
=== 4.1 Complexity, Modularity
Easy to add supporting tool, ex: ccache

=== 4.2 Reusability, Portability, Deployability

=== 1.1 Requirements overview

Flash bootloader is a software in flash. It allows to reflash application software over CAN communication. 
Tool can be used to send request and receive respond from ECU.


.Main features:
** It is the first software when MCU power-on
** It is responsible for FBL service check validation and respond
** It control checking and jumping to application software

.The following goals have been established for this system:
[cols="^3,20"]
|===
|Priority |Explicite functional Requirement

|1
|FBL SW shall support reflashing service via Tool

|1
|FBL SW shall support checking validity of application software before decision whether jump to app or not

|2
|FBL SW shall have size less than 10K (*)

|2
|FBL SW shall support checking validity of receiving message in specical case (**)

|1
|FBL SW shall fit with MCU without Non-volotile memory

|=== 

(*) Accepted Maximum size is 14K

(**) specical case: receive new application SW

== 2. Contraints

* Only support STM32F103C8T6 Hardware

*	Porting hardware. Hardware must satisfy:
**	RAM minimunsize: 20K
** ROM minimunsize: 4K
** Support CAN standard hardware
** Integration MCAL and Application. Required MCAL:
*** STD Driver library


== 3. Context and Scope

=== 3.1 Business context

Business context descript data exchanged with the environment of the system.

=== 3.2 Technical context

Technical context descript technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) between the system and its context.

== 8. Crosscutting concepts

=== 8.1 Diag message

* Motivation: + 
** Each service need to communication with Tool to send and receive status in service process +
** These message need follow one specific format (diagnostic communicaition)

* Solution: +
** Diag com module will define standard format for message before send/receive to CAN driver +
** Diag com will be included into all service module to perform transmit formal data

=== 8.2 Nvm interaction

* Motivation: + 
** Some service need to check/write Nvm data to perform next step +

* Solution: +
** Nvm handler module will provide API for other module to read and write data. Other module will not access to NVM driver directly. Handling Nvm driver will be handle by Nvm handler +
** Nvm handler will be included into all service module to perform process Nvm data

== 10. Quality requirements

//This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)
//Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

=== 10.1 Quality Requirements

=== 10.2 Quality Scenarios

== 11. Risks and Technical Debt

//Hardware without Nvm => can not check validation of app sw each ig cycle

|===
| Risk |Desdription |Priority |Impact

| Hardware without Nvm
| SW can not store validity of APP SW
| 1
| FBL can accept/auto jump to APP althougth APP SW invalid

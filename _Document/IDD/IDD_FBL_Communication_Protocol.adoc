=== 1.2 Overview

FBL need communication with Diag tool to receive request/data from tool and respond information


== 2. General description

=== 2.1 Message introduction

Each communication between the system and Diag tool is called a message. A message is a set of data structures defined by the FBL for communication between the external system and FBL.

=== 2.2 Message category

|===
| Message type |Function description | Message sending direction

| Request message
| Request messages are used for external systems to send requests to FBL
| Host System -> FBL

| Response status Message
| A response message is a response from FBL to Host System about status of request
| FBL -> Host System

| NRC message
| NRC message is a response from FBL to Host system about the failure of request message
| FBL -> Host System

|===

=== 2.3 Request Principles

FBL determines a unique message request based on the requestId in the message. If requestId is a process handling, first message of Tool will indicate requestId, next message of tool will contain data of request sequence.

=== 2.4 Response Description

After receiving the request message from the host system, FBL will strictly verify the content information in the request message. 

* If the content information has failure or unfit with data stored in FBL, FBL will return NRC. 

* If FBL handle request unsuccessfully, FBL will send NRC to host system.

* If FBL handle request successfully or right receive data or need more time to process, FBL will send Response status Message to host system.

* FBL only respond "need more time to process" maximum one time of each receive message. Next respond of FBL after "need more time to process" only can NRC or status Message.

* When FBL send "need more time to process", Host system must wait FBL send status message, then Host system can continue send request message. If Host send message when recieve "need more time to process", FBL will send NRC.

* Maximum wait time from "need more time to process" to send status message/NRC of FBL is 3s.

* Maximum wait time to receive message in a service proccess is 5s. After 5s, FBL will send timeout NRC.


== 3. Protocol description

=== 3.1 Hardware communication interface

* CAN communication
* CAN standard (8 bytes data)
* Bit rate: 

=== 3.2 Client-server communication pattern

Clients and servers exchange messages in a requestâ€“response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response.
